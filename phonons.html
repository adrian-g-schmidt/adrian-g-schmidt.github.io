            <strong>Description:</strong> The quantum phonon experiments are part of the research I did for my honours project. The main goal of these experiments was to test whether a particular crystal (Er<sup>3+</sup>:Y<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>) would be suitable for holding large amounts of quantum information. Quantum vibrations (phonons) can form when a crystal is excited when putting in information using a laser. These phonons could interfere with the other information being stored. Knowing if phonons occur and their impact in this crystal is vital for understanding the viability of using it in future quantum devices.

            For large quantum networks, where quantum computers are connected across a distance, the information from one computer needs to travel to the other. Light diminishes when travelling across a cable or through the air, so it must be boosted along the way. Measuring quantum information changes it, so a method is required to enhance a diminished quantum signal without measuring it.

            One approach is to, using a laser, put the information into a medium that can hold it for a moment and then spit the information back out without measuring it. Much of the research at the time was about refining the efficiency of storing a single quantum bit of information (a qubit). In the future, these materials will need to store significantly more qubits. A commonly suggested way to do this is by holding the qubits next to each other in the crystal (spatial multiplexing).

            A material of interest for our research groups is Er<sup>3+</sup>:Y<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub> (Erbium doped Yttrium Orthosilicate). This is because it has efficiently held information using a wavelength of light compatible with fibre-optic cables. My research was about understanding whether the excited atoms in the material formed phonons and how those phonons would affect the other excited atoms. I needed to design and execute an experimental setup that would allow me to do this. My Honours supervisors, Dr Rose Ahlefeldt, Associate Professor Matthew Sellars, and a PhD student, James Stuart, supported me in understanding background information and constraints and setting up and running the experiment.

            There were several constraints to measuring how phonons occurred in the crystal. The crystal needed to be at very low temperatures and under a magnetic field, as these are the conditions where qubits could be held at the highest efficiency. In our lab, these conditions require setting the crystal onto a metre-long rod, directed down to the bottom of a 1m tall tank (called a cryostat). The cryostat is then placed under a vacuum, filled with liquid nitrogen, and then liquid helium to reach 1.7 K (-456℉). We would then turn on a large electromagnet to apply a magnetic field.

            I required two lasers to excite the crystal and measure its change. For taking measurements, one laser must reach the crystal and then enter a detector. The second laser would then excite the crystal and potentially create phonons. There is a window at the bottom of the cryostat where laser light can enter and leave.

            The crystal was very small - 3x4x5 mm- and needed to be placed at one of a few orientations. Other orientations result in the crystal being aligned differently with the magnetic field, changing the frequencies atoms can be at and the ability to store information efficiently. We did want to slightly shift the frequencies though, as this could give information about the frequency of the phonons that occur. The two main ways to do this are rotating the crystal while in the cryostat or increasing and decreasing the magnetic field. We also wanted to test how the phonons change as they travel further distances. This information would help us understand what type of phonons are occurring, how far apart qubits would need to be stored, and develop potential mitigation techniques.

            For the rod setup, a mirror needed to be placed on the far side of the crystal for measurement. This meant the laser would pass through the window and crystal and hit the mirror. The light would then reflect back through the crystal and window, entering the detector. The part holding the crystal would therefore need a gap so the laser could pass through.  
            <br><br>
            Between the two options of changing the magnetic field, and rotating the crystal, changing the magnetic field required more significant changes to the existing experimental setup. This meant I chose to turn the crystal while it was in the cryostat. The team had two attocubes available that rotate up to 3 degrees under very low temperatures and pressures. The attocubes don't have a built-in rotation measurement due to variations depending on the conditions. As such, I determined the rotation by measuring the distance of a laser's reflection off the crystal's face. The crystal needed to stay at the exact location while rotating, which defined its height above the platform. Unlike the crystal, the mirror needed to remain fixed, as moving it would reflect the measurement laser away from the detector.            
            <figure>

            To change the distance between the two lasers, one laser was placed on an adjustable platform underneath the cryostat, so I could vary its position. I needed the second laser to be able to overlap with the first on the crystal, so I used a particular type of mirror called a beam-splitter. This allowed me to change the distance between the lasers to see how the phonons travelled over different lengths. This also decided the orientation of the crystal, so I could have as great a range of distances available for testing.

            Combining these requirements, I designed a platform to mount the crystal on that attached to the attocubes for rotation and the rod. It would hold a mirror and the crystal at a particular height, rotating the crystal separately from the mirror. And it would have a hole so light could travel through the crystal to the mirror and be reflected back into a detector. I designed the specification for these two metal parts and they were manufactured by the Technical Officer.

            The experimental setup did not work the first time in the cryostat. Upon removal, I found the glue underneath the mirror had cracked under cold conditions. I re-glued the mirror and taped around it to ensure the mirror position remained fixed. After re-aligning the lasers, the experimental setup worked, with the laser successfully going into the crystal, hitting the mirror, and reflecting back into the detector. The second laser also successfully travelled along the crystal, and its effects could be seen in the measurements.

            From my experiments, I did find that phonons were occurring in this crystal, and several features of those phonons, including a frequency range, lifetime, and way the phonons were propagating. I learned so much from designing, performing, and analysing these experiments. The extreme conditions required imposed many boundaries on how my design was be implemented. It was satisfying to design a solution on paper, calculate all the exact distances and angles needed, and see it be manufactured into something physical that with worked with only small additional changes. 

            Although I've focussed primarily on the experimental design, I have written in detail about the findings in my Honours thesis, which you can read <a href="/assets/adrian-schmidt-honours-thesis.pdf">here</a>.
